[b]Concept:[/b] In a grimy, post-apocalyptic world, the most popular form of entertainment is
\"The Gauntlet,\" a live-streamed bloodsport where scavengers run a deadly, trap-filled ruin for the
promise of life-saving supplies. The streamer is the contestant. The Twitch chat? They are the
bloodthirsty audience and the show's producers, spending their \"caps\" (channel points) to influence
the show.

[b]Twitch Integration:[/b]

[b]Sponsor's Choice:[/b] The audience acts as the show's sponsors. At the start of a run, they can
vote to sponsor the streamer with a specific loadout—perhaps a rusty but powerful shotgun with
little ammo, a versatile but weak crossbow, or just a medkit and a prayer.

[b]Place Your Bets & Rig the Odds:[/b] Viewers can use channel points to \"bet\" on whether the streamer
will survive the next room. They can then use more points to influence the outcome. \"Helping\" bets
might reveal trap locations or spawn a health pack. \"Hindering\" bets could activate a hidden turret,
release a pack of mutated hounds, or make a crucial platform crumble.

[b]The Prize Vault:[/b] High-tier donations or sub-bombs contribute to the \"Prize Vault.\" If the
streamer successfully completes the gauntlet, they gain access to this viewer-funded cache of
high-tier loot for their next run. This creates a collective incentive for the audience to
occasionally help their favorite contestant succeed.

[b]Mutator Marketplace:[/b] Between runs, the chat can vote on \"Mutators\" for the next gauntlet. These
are global effects like \"Pitch Black\" (where flashlights are the only light source), \"Feral Frenzy\"
(enemies are faster and more aggressive), or \"Booby Trap Bonanza\" (the number of traps is doubled).

[b]Why it's Great for Streaming:[/b] This concept leans into the performative nature of streaming
itself. It creates a high-energy, action-oriented experience filled with thrilling highs and
devastating, often comical, lows. The direct \"producer\" role gives the audience a tangible impact
on the challenge, making every run a unique spectacle crafted by the community's whims."
